Json Schema
===========

Jane JsonSchema is a library to generate models and serializers in PHP from a `JSON Schema`_ draft v4.

Installation
------------

Add this library with composer as a ``dev`` dependency:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require --dev jane-php/json-schema "^4.0"

This library contains a lot of dependencies to be able to generate code which are not needed on runtime. However, the generated
code depends on other libraries and a few classes that are available through the runtime package. It is highly recommended
to add the runtime dependency as a requirement through composer:

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require jane-php/json-schema-runtime "^4.0"

By default, generated code is not formatted, to make it compliant to PSR2 standard and others format norms, you can add the
`PHP CS Fixer`_ library to your dev dependencies (and it makes it easier to debug!):

.. code-block:: bash

    composer require --dev friendsofphp/php-cs-fixer "^2.7.3"
